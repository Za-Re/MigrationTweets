		<p class="explanations">MigrAnalytics provides visual analysis of the tweets related to peak migration period. 
		It uses <a href="https://data.gesis.org/tweetskb/">TweetsKB</a> as a starting point and then formulates a search 
			criteria for extracting tweets by enriching the entities and hashtags starting from a seed word "Refugee" by using
			<a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a>, <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>. 
			It combines European migration statistics from <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat">Eurostat</a> with the information obtained by the tweets 
			and provides visual analysis from different perspectives.

			<p class="explanations">In below graphs, number of monthly tweets, retweets and favorites for years 2016 and 2017
				have been plotted. As it is expected these interactions counts follow the same trend. The red plot demonstrates
				the monthly number of asylum applications registered in EU during the corresponding years. However the number of
				tweets and asylum applications are not completely correlated, for some months in 2016 it could be seen the tweets
				count is affected by the applications count. The number of monthly asylum applications in 2017 is almost as half
			 	as applications in 2016; nevertheless, number of tweets in the latter year is much higher.</p>

			<h2 class="sub-section">3. Yearly top 20 entities and hashtags</h2>
			<p class="explanations">We first selected top 20 entities and hashtags of whole year 2016.
				Then they have been ranked and depicted based on their frequencies on a weekly basis.
				Among top 20 entities, there are 7 entities which do not contain any of our keywords we used to query.
				For example, Germany and Turkey are two countries and Donald Trump is a politician which co-occurred
				with our entity and hashtag keywords more often than their counterparts. Germany had the largest number
				of asylum applications in EU during this time period and Turkey as a transit country hosted
				the largest number of syrian asylum seekers in 2016. In 2017, many of co-occurred hashtags and entities
				with our primary keywords are related to US migration policies, including: Executive_order,
				Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals or its equivalent hashtag #daca, as well as #nobannowall, and #muslimban.
				Syria which had the highest number of asylum applications in EU for both 2016 and 2017, is the only country
				appeared among the 20 top hashtags in year 2017.

		    <h2 class="sub-section">4. Weekly top 100 entities and hashtags</h2>
			<p class="explanations">
				It is possible that an entity or hashtag represents the trending topics on Twitter for only a short time period but they are not
				among the whole year trending entities and hashtags. Therefore, To visualize entity and hashtag clouds, we took a different approach
				rather than the previous bar chart race visualizations. Here top 100 entities and hashtags are chosen over the course of each week which
				consequently leads to more informative visualizations. For example for the hashtag cloud of year 2017 between weeks 4 and 6, hashtags
				such as #muslimban, #nobannowall, #refugeesdetained, #buildthewall, #notoimmigrationban, #stopiranban, #refugeeban, and #immigrationban
				are among the hashtags with the highest frequency. These trending hashtags are obviously a response to Trump's executive order banning
				citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. This also could explain the sharp increase in number of
				tweets in number of tweets in the first months of 2017- especially in February- compared to the last months of 2016.

			<h2 class="sub-section">5. Monthly average of sentiments</h2>
			<p class="explanations">Each tweet has both positive and negative sentiment score which are between 0 and 1. To plot the monthly average
				of sentiments, we did not consider neutral scores. In the sentiment plot for year 2016, the average score for negative sentiments is ranging
				from 0.48 to 0.51, while for positive sentiments, it is much lower- fluctuating between 0.31 and 0.33. For year 2017, the average score for
				negative sentiments is ranging from 0.46 to 0.52. Similar to year 2016, average positive sentiment is much lower- fluctuating between 0.31 and 0.32.
				In general, based on monthly average sentiments for both years it could be interpreted that when it comes to subjective and opinionated
				tweets, the negative sentiment of tweets towards migrants is much more intense than positive ones.</p>
